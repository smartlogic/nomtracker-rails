	<h1>Who created nomtracker?</h1>
	<p>Nomtracker was created in Baltimore by the team at <a href="http://www.smartlogicsolutions.com/">SmartLogic Solutions</a> during our first <a href="http://twitter.com/hackurday">hackurday</a> event.</p>
	<p>In particular, the following people worked on it:
		<a href="http://twitter.com/abachman">Adam Bachman</a> (Ruby on Rails),
		<a href="http://twitter.com/gjastrab">Greg Jastrab</a> (Android app - still in development),
		<a href="http://twitter.com/jtrupiano">John Trupiano</a> (Ruby on Rails, business analysis / user stories),
		<a href="http://twitter.com/justinabrown">Justin Brown</a> (Adobe AIR app - still in development),
		<a href="http://twitter.com/hal678">Michael Berkowitz</a> (Ruby on Rails),
		<a href="http://twitter.com/ngauthier">Nick Gauthier</a> (Ruby on Rails, business analysis / user stories),
		<a href="http://twitter.com/yflicker">Yair Flicker</a> (visual design, iPhone app - still in development).
	</p>
	
	<h1>How did you come up with the idea for nomtracker?</h1>
	<p>Being a small company we often order lunch together.  Usually one person picks up the tab via CC, nobody has cash, and then people start owing people money, which is never a good thing.  To manage who owed whom what, we maintained a <a href="/images/spreadsheet.png" title="a rather complicated spreadsheet - SLS Debts">rather complicated spreadsheet</a>.</p>
	<p>Being a group of programmers / engineers, we thought, "Wouldn't it be nice to build an app to better manage the situation?"</p>
	
	<h1>What else is on the roadmap for nomtracker?</h1>
	<p>Hopefully a private API, iPhone app, Android app, AIR app and public API (roughly in that order).</p>
	
	<h1>Exit Strategy?</h1>
	<p>Excellent question - we're glad you asked.</p>
	<p>Nomtracker is a ground-breaking product - the only product of its kind.  As we continue to add more and more features to nomtracker, there is no doubt that more and more users will continue to visit the site and use the product.  The advertising potential will be enormous (if you owned a restaurant, wouldn't you want to buy an ad next to a debt associated with it?).</p>
	<p>Furthermore, there is tremendous demand in the developer community for a public API for nomtracker.  When we publish the API, we will cultivate an ecosystem around our product such that developers will use nomtracker as the backend for all of their complex software dealing with transactions.</p>
	<p>As the product evolves we envision a day in the near future when banks begin to use nomtracker for managing all of their deposits/debts (from consumers) and outstanding loans/credits (to consumers and banks).  We will negotiate a deal with the banks wherein we display advertisements on their websites.</p>
	<p>Shortly thereafter, the nomtracker platform will displace the NYSE and NASDAQ stock markets - why pay fees when you can use nomtracker for free?  We will pursue an exclusive deal with Jim Cramer wherein we allow him to barrage our customers with stock advice and take a cut of the ad revenue he generates on our website.</p>
	<p>As nomtracker begins to be used more and more often in daily life, we will build social networking features around the product.  This will be truly revolutionary - the first Web 2.0 Social Networking Website built around connecting those that have debts and credits with other normal people like you and me.  Scrubs already see the unique value proposition here - imagine being able to connect with someone with a large quantity of credits and bilking the putz out of more money.  Our unique technology will make this a reality.</p>
	<p>We will then be acquired by one of the usual suspects.</p>
