  # load up the seed data for your application. This is data that should be loaded when the
  # application is deployed to a server for the first time. For example, an Admin account and
  # models like FileType that are database-level constants.
  #
  # This is best run as a series of calls to private methods:
  #   self.load_people
  #   self.load_posts
  # etc...
  def self.load_seed
  
  end
  
  # Purge the seed data that you loaded
  #
  # The best way to do this is as follows:
  #   [People, Posts, ... etc ].reverse.each do |model|
  #     model.destroy_all
  #   end
  # You should have an array of the models *in the same order* as in your load method. You should
  # have ALL of the models in the database in this table to be safe.
  def self.purge_seed
  
  end
  
  # Load up testing data for your test suite. Follows same pattern as load_seed
