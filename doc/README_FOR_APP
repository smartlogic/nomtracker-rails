iPhone API calls
-----------------

"/balances" (StartController ln. 22) -
  calls current_user.iphone_balances, which returns a stripped down XML version of a user's balances.

"/emails" (StartController ln. 26) -
  returns XML containing only primary email addresses for all users not current_user (will be changed to restrict returned list to network)

"/transactions_with_user/:id" (StartController ln. 30) -
  calls current_user.transactions_with(id) to return custom XML for all transactions between current_user and User.find_by_id(id), or returns an empty set if User.find_by_id(id) is nil

TransactionsController.set_iphone_params (private method, TransactionsController ln. 66) -
  Method to properly set params sent from the iPhone into the configuration expected by the Rails app.
  The :email and :transaction_type parameters are not attributes on transaction, and the Rails app expects them as params[:email],
  not params[:transaction][:email], which is how they are returned from the iPhone. This function properly sets the parameters so that
  the :create method can function without having to update it significantly.
